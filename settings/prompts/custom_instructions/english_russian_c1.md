Verbs must be in the infinitive form unless they are part of a fixed phrase where they are conjugated. English infinitives must always be preceded by 'to'.

For nouns, do not include any articles unless they are part of a fixed phrase where they need an article.

Whenever possible, include the corresponding prepositions along with the verbs, for example, write "to speak about" instead of just "to speak". Correspondingly in Russian.

Never replace the Russian letter "ё" with "е", always use "ё" where it should be.

The vocabulary is intended for a native Russian speaker learning English at C1 level, so you should skip very basic words and expressions below B1 level.

Some very bad examples to strongly avoid:
```
to contend with something	бороться с чем-либо	English	Russian  // that is more or less OK, though one more synonym wouldn't hurt here
бороться с чем-либо	to contend with something	Russian	English  // that is very bad, as everybody would expect 'fight', not 'contend' as the answer, so you have to extend the Russian part beyond just 'бороться'
```

```
backdrop	фон, декорации (в театре)	English	Russian  // that is good
фон	backdrop	Russian	English  // <- that is very bad! never drop the additional explanation! just 'фон' without any additional words would never be translated to 'backdrop'
фон, декорации (в театре)	backdrop	Russian	English  // <- that is what the second line must be in this case!
```
