Never edit `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `.env`, or any git files unless you are explicitly instructed to do so. 

All your pip/uv/python commands in bash must be **run inside** the `.venv` environment, **always have it activated**, **never use the global environment!**

All the files must be read and written in utf-8 encoding.

Avoid `from __future__ import ...` imports. 

Use modern Python typing syntax like `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`, `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`, etc.

Use relative imports like `from ..logging import get_logger` instead of `from anker.logging import get_logger`.

Always keep consistent, concise but thorough, meaningful logging of what is happening, with appropriate levels from `DEBUG` to `ERROR`. Do not use `print()`.

Handle the errors gracefully, depending on their severity. For connection errors, use `tenacity` to retry.

The choice of libraries are already made, see the `pyproject.toml` file.
